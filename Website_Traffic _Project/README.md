# Website Conversion Project

## Objective:
Analyze the Conversion rate of website traffic, from visits to purchases.

## Dataset:
- **Source:** Codecademy fictional database for Python project
- **Details:** 4 CSV files including: visits, cart, checkout and purchase.

## Tools Used:
- Jupyter for Python

## Methodology:
- Data Cleaning & Preparation in SQL
- RFM Segmentation Analysis
- Data Visualization in Tableau

## Key Insights:
- 17.4% of visits added items to cart, 65% of carts were checked out, 75.5% of checkout ended up to be a complete purchase.
- The average time it took from a visit to a final purchase was 43 minutes.

## Recommendations:
- The biggest drop-off of the funnel is from visit to cart; hence, the seller should test:
  1/ An "add-to-cart", sizes (if multiple sizes offered per item) and quantity buttons next to each item in the home page to make purchasing process easy.
  2/ A category page or home page with interactive image carousels per item along with a short description, making it easy for consumers to get the most important within the first 5 seconds and encourage quick decisions.
  3/ Simplify the Product Category or Navigation section, make it easy for consumers to find items or browse.
  4/ Implement the full "category-path" (showing a breakdown of categories and subcategoris the current item is wthin) to help consmers go back to the most recent subcategory without having to go back to the home page.
