# Biodiversity   Project

## Objective:
Perform data analysis on the conservation statuses of species within 4 parks managed by National Parks Service and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

## Dataset:
- species_info.csv - contains data about different species and their conservation status
- observations.csv - holds recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for 7 days.

## Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology:
- Data Cleaning & Visualization with Python

## Key Insights:
- Among 4 Conservation statuses, most species fall within the category of "Species of Concern", followed by "Endangered", "Threatened and then "In Recovery".
- Among animal categories, Mammal has the highest percentage of species falling within the category of Endangered.
- Among 4 observed parks, Yellowstone has the highest number of observations within these conservation statuses, followed by Yosemite, Bryce and finally, Great Smokey Mountain.
